<h3>About This Project</h3>

<p>This project was part of the Fullstack Javascript track, specifically the introductory Web Development course on <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">Odin Project</a>. The idea was to implement a console based tic-tac-toe game (I addded the UI for fun) to practice using Javascript fundamentals, the Developer Console, and version control with Git.
